magnets
=======

 This is a short technical test that I did to enter in the company where I made my intership.
 
 The idea is to have a button, and when you click it, a color square appear on the window. And when you drag a square close other square they will convert in one square, like magnets. 
 
 I just have a short time in one afternoon for do that in the company so it have a little bugs. The squares appear always in the same part of the window so you have to move them over the window, and the squares just can have 5 different colors.
